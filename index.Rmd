# An Intuitive Introduction to R

## Welcome !

Welcome to this R course! In this course I will teach you the workflow from raw data to your very first analyses in R. When I was a beginner myself, I tried a lot of courses like this, but there were two points, which I think slowed down my learning process, I do want to make different with this course:

-   The courses taught way too much unnecessary stuff for the beginning. It does not matter to know several variations of a command for example, the intuition is way more important.

This course was originally a tutorial for my juniors at my university and I asked myself the question: What do they need to know, to conduct data analyses themselves with R? Well, they have to get an intuition of the workflow. So I decided to design a course, that instead of showing unnecessary variations of functions aim to show how to analyse a question of interest.

-   The courses were not reproducible! That is not the directly the fault of the courses. There are tools to make R scripts reproducible, however they are not beginner friendly, so the authors of those courses are facing a trade-off: Teaching unnecessary complicated stuff at to beginners, or to leave it out and make the course not reproducible.

This course is different! In this course, you can download R-scripts and load them directly on your own device and follow the course by executing the codes for yourself to have the original experience of working with R.

## About this Course

### Prerequisities

-   `R` and RStudio. You should download the most current version of R and RStudio. How to do that easily is described here.

### What is `R` and `RStudio` ?

`R` is a programming language specifically developed for statistical analysis. `RStudio` is a nice graphical interface to work with R.

### Why `R` ?

-   Free of cost and open-source
-   Functionalities for all steps of research process from Data Collection to Data Analysis
-   Programming language specifically developed for statistical analysis
-   Very active Community:
-   e.g. `R` community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)
-   e.g. *#rstats* on twitter

### What expects you and what not

In this course you will learn:

-   To get familiar with `R` and its basic language
-   Core commands from the tidyverse package
-   Data Wrangling, Data Bridging, Data Munging, Data Manipulation
-   An efficient Workflow
-   A brief introduction into basic Data Analysis

You will **not** learn:

## About Me

My name is Okan and I am a Data Scientist. To be more precise, my profession is Data Science, but originally I graduated in Political Science. I know, what kind of transition is that? From Politics to Data? Well, my university was specialized in empirical research and Political Science was no exception. To explain political phenomena, I analysed large data sets and it was the most fun part of my studies. So I decided to become a Data Scientist and I could not be happier about that decision!
